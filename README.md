## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you can compile and run the C files, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: The standard C compiler on most Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.
  - On Linux, you can install it using the package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install gcc` on Ubuntu).
  - On macOS, you can install it via Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
  - On Windows, you can use MinGW or Cygwin to get GCC.

- **Make** (Optional but recommended): A build automation tool that can help manage the compilation process.
  - On Linux, you can install it using `sudo apt-get install make`.
  - On macOS, it's included with Xcode Command Line Tools.
  - On Windows, you can install it through MinGW or Cygwin.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **(Optional) Build the project**:
    If a `Makefile` is provided in the repository, you can compile the project using:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage

Here, you can describe how to use the C files in the project. For example:

- **To compile a single C file**:
    ```bash
    gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
    ```
    This command will compile `source_file_name.c` and create an executable named `output_file_name`.

- **To run the compiled program**:
    ```bash
    ./output_file_name
    ```

## Running the Program

After compiling, you can run the program as follows:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the compiled executable.
2. Run the program by typing `./output_file_name` in the terminal.

If your program takes command-line arguments, you can pass them like this:

```bash
./output_file_name arg1 arg2
